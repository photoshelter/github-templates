## Github Templates

The Github Templates that we use for all of our projects.

**Usage:**

You can download a zip/clone this repo and manually move the files over if you would like. Or if you are already using [Bower](https://bower.io/), you can run this [template refresh script](./template_refresh.sh) in your project at the root level. This is the prefered method, because much easier to just occasionally run the script and poll for a newer version.
