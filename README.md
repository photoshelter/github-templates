## Github Templates

The Github Templates that we use for all of our projects.

**Usage:**

If you can download a zip or clone the repo and manually move the files over, or if you want to leverage bower you can install it, move what you need and clean up what you don't by including this [template refresh script](./template_refresh.sh) in your project and running it at the root level.
